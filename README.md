# Welcome to our food store

This is an attractive drag and drop food store created with HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5.0 and JavaScript. It is quite simple, you just drag the element you desire to buy and drop it inside the drop zone. However, you can also press the green button and add the item into the shopping car.
